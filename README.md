Description and storyboard
The player’s goal is to survive for as long as possible. However the challenge the player needs to constantly overcome is their energy (HP) management. If the player does not bring enough food back to the nest, they starve through the night and lose energy points. The only way to prevent that is to bring back more food than required to gain additional energy points per additional food.
However, although the player can move freely (they cannot move over obstacles) on the map to gather food, every time the player moves they lose some energy points. Moreover, there and natural enemies linger outside that will attack the player and reduce their energy points.
